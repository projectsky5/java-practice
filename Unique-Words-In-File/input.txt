Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Java code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM allows Java programs to be compiled once and run anywhere.

Public classes in Java should be named after the file. A class can contain fields and methods. Java has primitive types like int, boolean, and double.

Override methods with @Override annotation. Use Math and Regex utilities in Java if needed.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
}
